# Matthew Tobin's Portfolio 
Created a live portfolio for prospective employers to have a one stop shop of content about me, my work and how to contact me.  

## Project Description
This project consists of a HTML file, a CSS file and multiple images used for the portfolio. The HTMl file was structured
to display multiple sections that employers can view. Those sections are as follows:

* A header with my Name and navigation bar that will allow the user to jump to certain sections within the page.
* A hero image with a Welcome message.
* An about me with a brief summary of who I am, what I'm passionate about and my background.
* Screenshots with links that showcase the projects I have built. 
* The first project that I built is represented by the largest image on the page within the Projects section.
* Each project image has a hyperlink that will take the user to the deployed version of that project.
* A section that directs the user to my GitHub account and an option to email me.

The main intent of the CSS sheet was to show the different sections within a flexbox to display items in columns. The 
purpose of using flexbox was to make the readability of the page better. The page was then styled to ensure that the 
page was responsive to different device sizes.

This portfolio will be a living web page and updated as I learn new skill and build more projects.
